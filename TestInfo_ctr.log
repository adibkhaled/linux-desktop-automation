### Testing needed?

Yes, already tested, but you can verify the hardware connection using the `stacklight` demo program (ask the SW test), it is literally called `stacklight` but it needs to be build for the specific platform your are on. (OS-10 or OS-12).

Then, the error states can be tested by introducing a real error and verifying the behavior.
It might be good to test what happens when the vcenter starts up with and without an error already active.

### Testing needed?

Yes

- without a monitor connected, boot the system and connect via SSH and run `scripts/monitor.sh configuration virtual`, then reboot the system.
- now VNC should be able to connect with the normal resolution even without a monitor connected.
- `scripts/monitor.sh configuration normal` will switch it back to using the physical monitor.

07-28 14:22:            INFO     I propose we either integrate this into `scripts/monitor.sh` or create a new script to enable/disable this. For example
- `$ scripts/monitor.sh set virtual 1280 1024`
- `$ scripts/monitor.sh set default`  <= would find out what it the first connected output and set it as the current output with 1280x1024 resolution

07-28 14:22:            INFO     I really like the solution since it does not involve a reboot and is easily revertible. 
However, for Entresol usage, using the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` method might still be preferable because no extra actions are needed when connecting a monitor to a system that was booted without one.

Test scenario:
- system without a monitor, we lost the network connection and want to find out what happened, it would be nice if plugging in a monitor was possible to troubleshoot it.

I'm not sure if that scenario is easy (or even possible) in either case.
Like @Adriaan.deGroot mentioned in our casual conversation over beer, we might be able to detect the monitor being connected and act on that?
07-28 14:22:            INFO     This is not necessary. You can configure Xorg with a specific (default) virtual framebuffer size. This can be done also when there are no monitor devices connected.

Put the following in the file `/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-monitor.conf` (do this as root):

```
Section "Screen"
    Identifier  "DefaultScreen"
    Monitor     "DefaultMonitor"
    DefaultDepth    24
    SubSection  "Display"
        Depth   24
        Virtual 1280 1024
    EndSubSection
EndSection
```

No additional configuration is needed. Optionally, restart X.

An example of output, after ssh'ing in to the system with no monitor devices connected, is this:

```
# DISPLAY=:0 xrandr
Screen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1280 x 1024, maximum 8192 x 8192
VGA-1 disconnected primary (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
DP-1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
HDMI-1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
HDMI-2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
```

Setting different values for `Virtual` in the config file will get a different description of *Screen 0*. The VNC server that is started by nodm follows the virtual desktop size.

After connecting a monitor, you need to enable the output again; otherwise nothing is displayed. To do so, set an output to any useful size. For instance, after connecting the VGA cable, use `DISPLAY=:0 xrandr` to check that the cable is connected and that the monitor supports the desired output size. Having checked that it is connected, turn the output on with the desired mode:

```
# DISPLAY=:0 xrandr --output VGA-1 --mode 1280x1024
```

Stacklight behavior for the I/O based stacklight should still be the same (e.g. blinking / solid green in normal operation depending on inspection state, yellow / red / alarm buzzer depending on configuration and actions during inspection). If there is a USB stacklight available, it should demonstrably have the same behavior after configuring the stacklight type to be 6.

### Testing needed?

Yes

- test 1
  - make sure `/home/vimec/vic/filecam` does not exist
  - start Vcenter normally, no extra camera should appear
- test 2
  - make sure `/home/vimec/vic/filecam/cam1` exists and contains nothing
  - start Vcenter, 1 extra 'Vimec' camera should be available that produces black images.
- test 3
  - make sure `/home/vimec/vic/filecam/cam1` exists and contains images (.png or .pgm) from a take that is the correct size of the module under test
  - start Vcenter, 1 extra 'Vimec' camera should be available that produces all the images if you click 'once' 
- test 4
  - create '/home/vimec/vic/filecam/cam1/config.json' with this content:

```
{"SensorSizeX" : 1282, "SensorSizeY" : 1026}
```

and 

```
{"SensorSizeX" : 5472, "SensorSizeY" : 3648}
```

And check the values are used at the 'sensorsize', this can be observed in the 'camera' tab, because the images from the /cam1/ directory will be positioned on a background the size of the sensor.

Restart VCenter is working again.

### Testing needed?
Yes
### Current [bug] behavior
V-Center 3.20.0.0-RC4 does not start when at some point in the past 3.15.5.x was installed (which leaves behind `/etc/vimec/user_vimec_vcenter`).
### Steps to test the issue
Verify that after installing packages `/etc/vimec/user_vimec_vcenter` is removed and V-Center can be started again through the icewm menu.

07-28 14:22:            INFO     The culprit seems to be file `/etc/sudoers.d/user_vimec_vcenter`. This file is installed with V-Center version 3.15.5.x (and possibly also 3.15.4.x). This file is not owned by any package so the file remains, even when upgrading to a newer V-Center version. This was not a problem until we started shuffling around scripts. The solution is to simply remove the unowned `/etc/sudoers.d/user_vimec_vcenter` file from `postinst` of the `vcenter-application` package.

- If you can, pick *Logout* > *Restart icewm* from the menu and see if that helps.
- Please run `grep VIMEC /home/vimec/.icewm/menu` to see what the program-definitions are (this should work both as *root* and as Linux-user *vimec*)
- The **normal** definition of the restart-VIMEC menu entry is `/home/vimec/scripts/restartvimec 0` . Enter that command at the shell-prompt (as Linux-user *vimec*) and see what heppens.

07-28 14:22:            INFO     - The existing `StatusButton` class uses a spinner icon / spinner pixmap and has a caching implementation
- Creating a spinner label that uses that, and making the spinner pixmap cache available to both label and button would be an improvement and provide a centralized place for the images
- Use the waiting-spinner widget from *progmotors*
- Update the spinner to not be petals / lines .. the boring kind of spinner, but use a Vimec rotowheel graphic and spin it in the same cadence that the line would rung. That would be an attention-to-detail UI fanciness patch.

You must install from a **new** ISO. Either use the nightly from the day after this is closed (so the 06-27 nightly) or fetch a manually-built ISO, which you can get (until the next cleanup of manual ISOs) from `Z:\Vimec\Projects\application\v-center-linux\bookworm\manual\7669-os-12-teamviewer-is-not-able-to-connect-after-installing-t\e048b57d\iso`

07-28 14:22:            INFO     ### Getting a OS-12 ISO to a Working Situation

- (re)install from the ISO
- `apt update`
- `apt install lightdm`
- Edit the *lightdm* configuration and enable autologin
- Add `xhost +local:` to various scripts that start V-Center
- Reboot

The *lightdm* configuration does proper session-registration so that TeamViewer works, while *xhost* then allows the *vimec* user (or any other local Linux user on the V-Center PC) to connect to the X Server.

Downside is that "logout" drops you to the greeter, rather than automatically logging in again; I suppose customers might need to know about *desktop:desktop* to get back in.
07-28 14:22:            INFO     Installed a VM with an ISO generated from branch `7601-release-candidate-3-20-0-0`. This installation comes with TeamViewer 15.65.6, which is currently not the latest version (latest is 15.66.5, but a quick test shows the same problem on that version).

What we've tried:
- Relax access rights for TeamViewer related files (`/etc/teamviewer/`, /opt/teamviewer/`, `/run/teamviewer*`, /home/desktop/.config/teamviewer/`, `/home/desktop/.local/share/teamviewer15/`)
- Looked at logging in `/home/desktop/.local/share/teamviewer15/logfiles/TeamViewer15_Logfile.log` after setting the log level in TeamViewer to log everything (via advanced settings). We observe some `ForwardCommandToSession()` messages, but those same message are observed on a system at which TeamViewer can connect to
- Looked at logging in the systemd logging service through `journalctl`. No obvious warnings or errors are observed.
- Looked at output of `strace` for both `TeamViewer` and `teamviewerd`. No warnings or errors are observed.

### Current [bug] behavior
After a cold reset (i.e., power cycle) the connection to a CME2 device must be reset multiple times before communication to the device can happen without errors.
### Modules affected
Motorcontrol module
### Steps to test the issue
Execute a cold reset of the system and verify that the connection to the CME2 device is ok when V-Center is started. Also verify that the CME2 device can the be operated as normal.

Since there's no sensor agents to stop and there's no valid information available on how to contact a sensor agent (hence the `@ n/a:-1` address in the screenshot of the issue description) error messages are printed. The solution should be to skip `StopSensorAgents` if the sensing component is not enabled.

- As Linux-user *desktop* you should not be able to execute `/home/vimec/scripts/cleanup.sh`
- As Linux-user *vimec* you should be able to execute `/home/vimec/scripts/cleanup.sh`
- As Linux-user *vimec*, command `cleanup.sh` should also work
- There should be a prompt asking if you want to clean up, responding anything except `y`, `Y`, `yes` or `YES` should abort the cleanup
- After cleanup, statistics, images, etc. should all be gone and the system should be more like "freshly installed" except that the configuration is preserved.

As a bonus, check in e.g. the `vic/conf/` directory to see if there are any cruft-files (useless ini-files, random-ass backups of ini-files) and report them so that the tool can be improved to clean up more of the cruft from existing backup-files.

See issue description. In addition, make sure that `/var/coredump/` is empty before starting V-Center, then start it and either force-restart, or run `killvcenter` from the command-line, and verify that there are still no cores.

### Steps to test the issue
Verify that the name a created backup contains `OS-<debian_version>` in its name, and not the Debian codename (e.g., Buster, Bookworm). So:
- For Buster: `OS-10`
- For OS-12: `OS-12`

### Testing needed?

Start with a new slave (e.g. install V-Center packages on it, then run the make-it-a-slave-PC script). That part (esp. installing V-Center packages) is needed, to change the permissions on file `/etc/localtime`. It should look like this:

```
-rw-rw-r-- 1 root vimec 2198 Jun 18 15:54 /etc/localtime
```

Then time-and-date synchronization works between master and slave.

Note that the "synchronization" choice in *time-admin* doesn't work, and it isn't going to work either. That doesn't really matter: we are running *ntpd* anyway, so the time is sycnhronized even though *time-admin* doesn't recognize that fact.

07-28 14:22:            INFO     ### Log Message Generation on OS-10

The command `/usr/bin/logger` (*logger(1)*) can be used to generate log messages that go to syslog. For instance (either as root, or as user vimec, on OS-10):

```
logger -s -i -p user.notice "Example message"
```

Here `-s` also prints the message to stderr, `-i` logs the process-ID, `-p` sets a log-level, and the message is the example message. More realistically (at least to resemble the problem OpenVPN creates when log-spamming), use log-level `daemon.warn`. For a denial-of-disk-space attack, put that invocation of `logger` in a `while true` loop.

After logging, check the tail-end of files in `/var/log` (e.g. `/var/log/messages`, `/var/log/syslog` and `/var/log/daemon.log`). Use `ls -latr` to list files with most-recently-changed last, then it is easy to see which files got the message. You can *tail(1)* multiple files at once (with `-f` as well) to watch as log-messages come in.

With the current combination of mode, max id and provided sequence you'll just generate the sequence `1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`.

07-28 14:22:            INFO     It looks like the directory `/etc/vimec/` is not created when installing packages on OS-12. The `postinst` of `vcenter-application` creates that directory for OS-10 only. When the directory does not exist, V-Center is indeed not able to save the e-mail settings to `/etc/vimec/vicconfignetwork.ini`.

### Testing needed?
Yes

See issue description. In a system that has validation of some sort you should have disabled buttons until you enable at least one measurement. 

### Configuration Needed

- You need to have at least one module, 
- in *Display* > *Validation* > *Setup* , ensure at least one module is set to *Automatic on pulse*
- in *Display* > *Validation* > *Modules*, enable at least one module that is set to *Automatic on pulse*
- in *Display* > *Validation* > *Validation* (the default page), column *On* should now show checkboxes
- **check** if none of the checkboxes are checked, the buttons *Validate* and *Calibrate* should be disabled,
- **check** otherwise, they might be enabled or disabled depending on the rest of the validation logic (e.g. inspection running, or whatever).
